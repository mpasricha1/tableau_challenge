<h3>Analysis</h3>
<h2>Top Ten Start and End Stations</h2> 
<p>The top ten start and stop statons all seem to fall in very likely areas. Mostly focused in Downtown Jersey City, almost all of the top 10 start and end stations center around a mass transit location. 
Grove street and the closest 2 bike racks can all be found in the top 5. Connections to the light rail and two other Path stations are also within the top 10, Also in the top 5 is the Sip Ave bike rack, this rack serves the Journal Square path station.</p>

<p>The second highest in both cases is the Hamilton Park bike rack. This is very interesting as, although it is a pretty popular park, the park itself does not seem to be the main reason for the popularity. 
Liberty State Park, which is a much larger park with a lot mroe traffice, does not even crack the top 10. This could be because more patrons of LSP tend to have their own bikes and do not rely on Citibikes to enjoy the park. 
The Hamilton park sits between the two of the more used Path stations</p>

<p>Citibikes seem to be more used in this area for commuting to these two stations. 
Drilling down to a random weekday and weekend, we can see a huge spike around 5-6 for the weekday. 
While Not much activity on the weekends at this time.</p>

<h2>Gender Breakdown</h2>
<p>Looking at the gender break down we see that Males tend  to ride more often than females do. 
There has though been an increase in female ridership between 2018 and 2019.</p>

<p>More interestingly, over the months of the years, we find a different breakdown when it comes to trip duration. Males tend to have a pretty steady average trip duration across the months.
This looks as if males are utilizing bikes more for commuting rather then leisure activities. Even looking at 2018 vs 2019 , there is not much of a change.</p>

<p>Females, on the other hand, tell a different story. Female trip duration does vary throught the year. During the fall and winter months of the year, it seems female riders follow a simlar pattern to the males, using Citibikes more for commuting. 
But during the warmer seasons, females are taking longer trips, Female ridership in the warmer months seems to be utilized more for leisure. Female riders trip duration also seem to be increasing from year to year.</p>
